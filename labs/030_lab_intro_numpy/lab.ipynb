    "This lab covered a lot of ground:\n",
    "\n",
    "* we used various NumPy functions to perform signal processing tasks, including synthesizing sinusoids, computing elemet-wise products of vectors and the sum of vector elements.\n",

    "  - we will see this method again later in the course\n",
    "* we measured how the phase changes when a sinusoidal signal is delayed.\n",
    "  - this verified a result we discussed in class\n",

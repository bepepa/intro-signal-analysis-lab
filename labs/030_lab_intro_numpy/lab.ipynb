    "## Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore properties of sinusoidal signals. Sinusoids are fundamental building blocks in signal processing. A thorough understanding of sinusoids is essential for mastering key concepts in signal analysis and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* practice your Python skills related to NumPy\n",
    "* learn to synthesize sinusoidal signals from a given specification\n",
    "* learn to measure the amplitude and phase from samples of a sinusoid\n",
    "* explore the effect that delaying a sinusoid has on the phase of the signal\n",
    "* explore the addition of sinusoids of the same frequency"

    "Our aim will be to synthesize music from sheet music. However, to simplify matters we will use keys on the piano instead of the placement of notes on the sheet of music to designate the frequency of the tones that make up the music. \n",
    "Specifically, we number all the keys on the piano from left to right and each key produces one of the tones that the sheet music indicates.\n",

    "For example, we will use as our reference note the A-note near the middle of the piano keyboard. This tone is sometimes called A-440 because its frequency is 440 Hz. The piano key to play A-440 is the 49-th key from the left. Therefore, we will designate the tone A-440 by its piano key number 49.\n",

Moreover, the ratio of frequencies produced by adjacent keys is constant. From these observations, it follows that the frequency from one key to the next increases by $2^{1/12} = \\sqrt[12]{2}$.\n",

    "Your task is to write a simple signal processing function named `moving_average`\n",
    "according to the following specifications:\n",
    "* Your function takes as it's first input a sampled signal $x[n]$ (variable name `xx`)\n",
    "  - this signal is passed as a NumPy array\n",
    "  - the signals may be complex-valued, e.g., complex exponential signals\n",
    "* The second parameter $M$ is the length of the siding average\n",
    "  - this parameter must a positive integer\n",
    "* your function must compute and return a sampled signal $y[n]$ (variable name `yy`) of the same length $N$ as `xx`\n",
    "  - The $n$-th sample $y[n]$ is computed from the input signal as follows \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    y[n] = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} x[n-k] \\quad \\text{for $n=0,1, \\ldots, N-1$}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    + the $n$-th sample of $y[n]$ is the average of the last $M$ samples of the input signal\n",
    "* Note that $x[n-k]$ may reference negative indices of the input signal (i.e., $n-k$ may be negative)\n",
    "  - when that happens, assume that $x[n-k]=0$\n",
    "  - in other words, treat those case as if $x[n]=0$ for all $n<0$.\n",
    "* Your function must handle the following special cases\n",
    "  - if the lengths of `xx` is zero, then `yy` must also be of length zero\n",
    "  - if $M\\leq 0$, then your function must raise a `ValueError`\n",
    "* Your function must include a proper *doc string*.\n",
    "  - this includes (at least) a description of the Parameters and Return values"
